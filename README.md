# LOL Collection

This webpage is made by [Simone Sun](https://github.com/mizardblack)for class Core
Studio, System homework **5-in-5**.

## Project Explianation

This webpage collects and display all the Instagram messages registered
under Simone Sun's Instagram account. Her emotions get to express
through these messages. It is also interesting to see sometimes she uses
**"lol"** as a polite reply when she was actually "speekless" or lost
interests. When she used a long word ending with repetitive "l "(for
example, "lollllll"), she was expressing joy or she actually felt funny
about the content.
